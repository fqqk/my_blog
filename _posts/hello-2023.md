## 目次

## 年末することなさすぎてこの記事を書いてる

年末帰省しなかったことを後悔してはいない。悲しいことに、年末に帰省しなきゃ会えないような友人がいない。（と思っている）
帰省はしたいが、わざわざ帰省ラッシュに合わせた行動を取る必要性もないなと思い、昨年 24 日から今日まで東京で過ごすことにした。
気になっていたアニメ作品は一通り制覇し、勉強もしたが、どうしても自由な時間が有り余りすぎて非常に退屈した。切り替えも難しい。
外に出たいけど大した用事もないし金もない。

## study period

In terms of time, it is roughly 150 hours.

This is the amount of time I would have been able to concentrate; in reality, I think I spent about 250 hours.

By the way, I majored in mathematics and physics in college. Physics? I don't really know." I was just studying so that I could get credits.
I spent my university days with the stance of "I don't know much about math and physics.
I don't think I can do math and physics better than high school students who are preparing for the university entrance exam.

## After taking the Level 2 exam...

On October 23rd, I successfully passed the 2nd level of the Statistics Test!!!
The passing line is 60 points, and I scored 68 points.
I am satisfied with the result because I personally felt that the questions this time were difficult.
As for the trend of the questions, there were many probability calculation questions, and the way the questions were presented was a little different from past papers, giving me the impression that the questions were based on real social problems.
I think there was a question on PM2.5.
I got the impression that many of the questions in the latter half of the test could be solved by remembering the formulas, and it was significant that I was able to catch up here.
I would have liked to get 80% if possible. But a pass is a pass, so I'm proud of myself.

## Next

In the future, I would like to relearn university mathematics from scratch in order to pass the first level of the Statistics Proficiency Test.

At the same time, I would like to practice applying the knowledge I have acquired so far to actual social problems in competitions such as kagle.

Ultimately, my goal is to discover and discover facts about the world that we don't know.
Until I am able to do so, I will continue to study hard.
