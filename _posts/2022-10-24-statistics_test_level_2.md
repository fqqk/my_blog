## Why the Statistics Test Level 2?

I consider myself a person who enjoys knowing the truth of the world and understanding about it.
I have no regrets about choosing my lab in college because of my relationships with people, and I also believe that it was that lab that allowed me to graduate.
However, if I had chosen a laboratory without considering human relations, I would have chosen a laboratory where I could study statistics and machine learning.
I started studying with a light heart, thinking that since I had graduated from university, I would like to take this opportunity to do something interesting by pursuing my favorite field of study.
I started my studies with a light heart.
First of all, I decided to take the statistics exam to acquire basic knowledge of statistics in the first and second years of college.

## study period

In terms of time, it is roughly 150 hours.

This is the amount of time I would have been able to concentrate; in reality, I think I spent about 250 hours.

By the way, I majored in mathematics and physics in college. Physics? I don't really know." I was just studying so that I could get credits.
I spent my university days with the stance of "I don't know much about math and physics.
I don't think I can do math and physics better than high school students who are preparing for the university entrance exam.

## After taking the Level 2 exam...

On October 23rd, I successfully passed the 2nd level of the Statistics Test!!!
The passing line is 60 points, and I scored 68 points.
I am satisfied with the result because I personally felt that the questions this time were difficult.
As for the trend of the questions, there were many probability calculation questions, and the way the questions were presented was a little different from past papers, giving me the impression that the questions were based on real social problems.
I think there was a question on PM2.5.
I got the impression that many of the questions in the latter half of the test could be solved by remembering the formulas, and it was significant that I was able to catch up here.
I would have liked to get 80% if possible. But a pass is a pass, so I'm proud of myself.

## Next

In the future, I would like to relearn university mathematics from scratch in order to pass the first level of the Statistics Proficiency Test.

At the same time, I would like to practice applying the knowledge I have acquired so far to actual social problems in competitions such as kagle.

Ultimately, my goal is to discover and discover facts about the world that we don't know.
Until I am able to do so, I will continue to study hard.
